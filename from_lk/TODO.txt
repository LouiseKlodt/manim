1. Mini Manim
Create a basic version of Manim which is easy install and only supports the basic functionality.

Framework for Geometry:

Points: A = [x,y] # x,y e Rat
Lines: l = <a : b : c>, # a,b,c e Rat

A lies on l <=> ax + by + c = 0

Join of points:
  A1 = [x1, y1], A2 [x2, y2] # A1, A2 distinct points
  then there is one line through A1, and A1 given by:
  l = <y1-y2 : x2-x1 : x1y2-x2y1>
